								<p>As a Computer Science student at the National Open University, I bring a blend of academic rigor and real-world application to my work. Born on February 15th, 1998, and raised in Benin City, Delta State, I've cultivated a diverse perspective that enriches my approach to problem-solving. Currently residing in Abuja, I embrace every opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills, staying abreast of the latest trends and technologies. With a passion for lifelong learning and a drive to excel, I'm poised to make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving field of technology.</p>
								<p>Driven by my relentless passion for learning, I've achieved significant milestones in both online and offline education. Notably, I hold a coveted Nano-Degree in Programming from Udacity, showcasing my proficiency in advanced programming concepts. Additionally, I've attained an entry-level Data Analyst certification, solidifying my expertise in data analysis fundamentals. Currently, I'm diligently working towards obtaining my CS50 certification with Harvard University.<br/ > <br /> Moreover, I've honed my data analysis skills through comprehensive training in Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Tableau, equipping me with the tools to dissect complex datasets and derive actionable insights. On the programming front, I've developed proficiency in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, empowering me to create dynamic and interactive solutions to real-world problems. With each accomplishment, I'm not just expanding my skill set; I'm building a foundation for a successful and impactful career in technology</p>
								<p>With several years of hands-on experience in technical roles, I've cultivated a wealth of expertise that has shaped my career trajectory. My journey began with a pivotal role as a website manager at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cashryte/?locale=ms_MY"><b>Cashryte</b></a> Medical Online Store. In this capacity, I took charge of designing and maintaining the company's website, ensuring it not only reflected the brand's identity but also provided a seamless user experience. Additionally, I spearheaded online product sales and marketing initiatives, leveraging digital platforms to reach and engage with our target audience effectively.

									During my tenure at Cashryte, I delved into the intricacies of marketing and sales, gaining invaluable insights that have since proven instrumental in my professional growth. Thanks to our concerted efforts, the Cashryte website consistently ranked well among its peers, a testament to our commitment to excellence in web management and digital marketing practices. With a keen eye for detail and a proactive approach, I ensured that all web activities ran smoothly, contributing to the overall success and reputation of the company in the online sphere. My tenure at Cashryte not only enriched my technical skill set but also honed my abilities in marketing, sales, and strategic business operations, laying a solid foundation for my continued advancement in the tech industry.</p>
								<p>In addition to my professional roles, I've dedicated my time and expertise to meaningful causes as a volunteer for the <b>African Heritage Foundation Nigeria (AHFN)</b> in Abuja, FCT, Nigeria. Serving as a United Nations Volunteer, I collaborated closely with the late Mr. Nathaniel, the director, on initiatives related to online fundraising and website operations. In this capacity, I leveraged my technical skills and strategic insights to support the foundation's mission of advancing social and humanitarian causes in the region. Through my contributions, I played a vital role in enhancing the online presence of AHFN and optimizing its fundraising efforts, thereby making a tangible impact on the communities we served. My experience with AHFN reaffirmed my commitment to using technology as a force for positive change and underscored the importance of volunteerism in driving meaningful societal transformation.</p>

								<p>In addition to my professional and volunteer endeavors, I've gained valuable political experience through my role at the <b>People's Democratic Party (P.D.P)</b> National Situation Room in Abuja during the primary and general elections in 2023. As an IT/Data Management support member, I was tasked with multifaceted responsibilities, including CRM database management, inbound and outbound call operations, technical issue resolutions, and report writing. Through this role, I honed my skills in information technology, data management, and communication, all while contributing to the democratic process of my country.

									Furthermore, my commitment to civic duty led me to serve as a returning officer for the Kogi State primary election, where I facilitated the electoral process with integrity and diligence. This experience not only deepened my understanding of political dynamics but also reinforced the importance of transparency and accountability in governance. Overall, my involvement in political activities has enriched my professional journey, providing me with invaluable insights and skills that continue to shape my contributions to society.</p>
